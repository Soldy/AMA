I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer.

Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Life. Code. Whatever.

#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question haven't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
